/** 
@page application Describing your application


* Interfaces to describe applications

- Simple C++ interface: S4U that is currently designed
- Simple Legacy C interfaces: MSG and SimDag, with comparison.
- Simple Java Interface: Currently MSG-based, but will be replaced with S4U stuff when ready
- MPI applications
- Event-oriented, and trace-based. The old documentation of the
  obsolete MSG module was removed in
  https://github.com/simgrid/simgrid/commit/e05361c201fb95d2b7605e59001cd0a49a489739

- Arbitrary applications: Simterpose and Remote SimGrid (they are currently far from being usable).
- State our goal of BYOS (build your own simulator), even if it's just a neat name for now
