MALLOC:
 You must cast the result of malloc on AIX. 
 It's even better to use gras_new when possible.

SIZE_T
 If possible, avoid size_t and use unsigned long instead.

 #include <sys/types.h> in all files manipulating size_t
 do cast it to unsigned long before printing (and use %lu)
 


PRINTF pointer difference
 printf ("diff = %ld\n", (long) (pointer2 - pointer1));
