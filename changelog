 [Data description]
   - register init/exit functions within gras module mecanism   
   - send/receive function. 
   Convertion is not implemented, but short-cutted if not needed.
   struct/array elements are sent one by one (instead of block-wise), but
     nobody really cares (yet). Get a prototype before optimizing.
   - tests (using a file socket) for DD send/receive on:
     - base types: int, float
     - array: fixed size, string (ie ref to dynamic string)
     - structure: homogeneous, heterogeneous
     - chained list, graph with cycle
   Believe it or not, valgrind is not too unhappy with the results. The
    cycle happily segfaults, but the others are ok. And I'm sick of pointers
    for now.
 [Transport]
   [File plugin] 
     - Bugfix when using a filename explicitely (instead of '-')
   [SG plugin]   
     - Porting to new standards.
   [SG select]   
     - Porting to new standards.

 [Transport plugins]
   - factorize more code between RL and SG in socket creation
   - Complete the implementation and tests of:
     o TCP
     o file (only in RL, and mainly for debugging)
     
     I lost 3 days to design a portable address resolver, and then decided
       that the prototype mainly have to run on my box.
     Addressing portability too early may be like optimizing too early :-/
 [Tests]
   - use gras_init in the Tests instead of the crappy parse_log_opt 
     (the latter function is removed)
 [Conditional execution]
   - New functions: gras_if_RL/gras_if_SG (basic support for this)
 [Code reorganisation]
  - Get rid of libgrasutils.a since it makes more trouble than it solves.
    Build examples against the RL library, since there is no way to disable
    its creation for now.
