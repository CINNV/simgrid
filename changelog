 - Create a new log channel tbx containing dict, set, log, dynar (to shut
   them all up in one shot)

 [Transport]
   - porting SG plugin and SG select to new standards (works almost).
   - plug memleaks and fix bugs around.
   
 [DataDesc] 
   - cleanup the prototype of data recv and force users to specify when they 
     want to handle references to objects. Test case working even for cycles.
   - plug memleaks. Valgrind is perfectly ok with this.

 [Transport] 
   - cleanup the separation between plugin and main code in plugin creation

 [Transport]
   - Reput hook for raw sockets, needed for BW experiments
   - kill a few lines of dead code
 [Data description] Interface cleanup
   - gras_datadesc_by_name returns the searched type or NULL.
     That way, no variable is needed to use a type desc once, which makes
      the code clearer.
   - gras_datadesc_declare_[struct|union]_append_name is removed. The last
      two parameters were strings (field name, type name), leading to
      common errors.
 [Dicos] Interface cleanup
   - gras_dico_retrieve -> gras_dico_get ; gras_dico_insert -> gras_dico_set 
     This is consistant with the dynar API.

   - Porting to new standards.
 [Data description]
   - interface cleanup. 
     There is no bag anymore, no need to take extra provision to mask the
       pointers behind "ID". 
     Better splitup of functions between files create/exchange/convert.
       This is still a bit artificial since convert and receive are so
       interleaved, but anyway.
 [Virtu(process)]
   - add a queued message list to procdata (the ones not matching criteria
     in msg_wait)
   - factorize some more code between SG and RL wrt procdata
 [Tests]
   - use gras_exit in example to track memleaks
   - get rid of gs_example now that GS is properly integrated into gras
   - update run_test to integrate the lastest tests (datadesc)
 [Logging]
   - rename WARNINGn macros to WARNn since it prooved error-prone

 [Data description]
   - register init/exit functions within gras module mecanism   
   - send/receive function. 
   Convertion is not implemented, but short-cutted if not needed.
   struct/array elements are sent one by one (instead of block-wise), but
     nobody really cares (yet). Get a prototype before optimizing.
   - tests (using a file socket) for DD send/receive on:
     - base types: int, float
     - array: fixed size, string (ie ref to dynamic string)
     - structure: homogeneous, heterogeneous
     - chained list, graph with cycle
   Believe it or not, valgrind is not too unhappy with the results. The
    cycle happily segfaults, but the others are ok. And I'm sick of pointers
    for now.
 [Transport]
   [File plugin] 
     - Bugfix when using a filename explicitely (instead of '-')

 [Transport plugins]
   - factorize more code between RL and SG in socket creation
   - Complete the implementation and tests of:
     o TCP
     o file (only in RL, and mainly for debugging)
     
     I lost 3 days to design a portable address resolver, and then decided
       that the prototype mainly have to run on my box.
     Addressing portability too early may be like optimizing too early :-/
 [Tests]
   - use gras_init in the Tests instead of the crappy parse_log_opt 
     (the latter function is removed)
 [Conditional execution]
   - New functions: gras_if_RL/gras_if_SG (basic support for this)
 [Code reorganisation]
  - Get rid of libgrasutils.a since it makes more trouble than it solves.
    Build examples against the RL library, since there is no way to disable
    its creation for now.
